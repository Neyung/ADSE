# ASEAN Data Science Explorers (2023) - Team Vitality
In this project, we conducted an extensive study on the economy of the Southeast Asia region, utilizing data from various open sources to create visual representations. The primary objective was to analyze factors that could impact economic growth or hinder the development of member countries. Based on the analysis, we proposed technological solutions to address the challenges faced by this region.

We believe that technological innovation must be accompanied by job security. Therefore, we highlighted potential risks to employment in member countries in the face of automation, using data and illustrative charts. To address this issue, we proposed an application to improve access to free technological knowledge for the public. This application would serve as a bridge between businesses providing free technological knowledge and those who need to use it.

# CHALLENGE
However, it is unfortunate that the majority of the population in Southeast Asian member countries has not yet achieved the necessary level of education, experience, knowledge, and conditions to keep up with the current technological explosion. Therefore, the possibility of them being "replaced" by robots in the future is an inevitable scenario.

# PROPOSAL
With the desire of "Innovating technology, but leaving no one behind", our team has built a non-profit learning application dedicated to the Southeast Asia region. By analyzing the current occupational knowledge of the people, we then propose suitable courses from various other technology training organizations.
